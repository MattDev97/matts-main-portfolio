			Hello! I'm Matthew Muenzberg, a front-end developer from the city of Cleveland, Ohio. 
			With over five years in the field, I've teamed up with various consultancies to bring top-notch web 
			solutions to life. When I'm not diving into code, you'll find me channeling my creative energy as a 
			musician in my band â€“ where the rhythm of music meets the logic of coding!
